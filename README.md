# React-Exam-Project from Nikolay Todorov

## ℹ️ About the project
This app was developed as part of my exam project at SoftUni. It features a fully functional back-end implemented with Node.js and a dynamic front-end built with React. It is based on a chat application. It allows logged-in users to chat with friends and family seemlessly with many themes you can choose from and the option to change details to your account.

### Here you can briefly see how it is: <br>


## 👨🏼‍💻 Project Setup & Start Guide

This guide explains how to start both the server and the client of the project so it can be ready for use.

### 🤖 Fist: Installation and start the server side:

1. Install dependencies for the REST-API server:

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd back-end
    - npm i (install)

3. Start the REST-API server:
    - npm run dev

✅ If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

   Server is running on port 5173
   <br>Connected to MongoDB
    

### ⭐ Second: Installation and start the client side:

1. Install dependencies for the client (SPA):

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd front-end
    - npm i (install)

3. Start the Application:
    - npm run dev

✅ If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

VITE v6.2.1  ready in 821 ms
    <br>Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    <br>Network: use --host to expose
    <br>press h + enter to show help

Ensure the REST API server is running before starting the SPA to enable proper integration.
